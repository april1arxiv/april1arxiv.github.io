Using Gaia EDR3, we study the most spectacular and photogenic cluster of Ptolemy. After deriving its membership, we identify in its colour-magnitude diagram a star that definitively decided to straggle and dress in blue. Further analysis with the FARCE telescope allows us to discover in its light curve the secret of its rejuvenation, which we gladly share in this paper. This research is an important contribution to attain the ultimate goal of astronomy as professed by DJ Format.
