We describe the discovery of a new kind of radio transient, which we call "early-riser bursts" or ERBs. We found this new class of source by considering traditional radio searches, but extending into the complex plane of dispersion measure. ERBs have the remarkable property of appearing before they are searched for. We provide suggestions for the most likely origin of this new astronomical phenomenon.
