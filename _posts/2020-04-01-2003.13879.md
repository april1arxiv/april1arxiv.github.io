In this paper we assess the correlation between recent observing runs (2018 and 2019) and inclement weather, and demonstrate that these observing runs have seen much more rainfall than would otherwise be expected, an increase of over 200%. We further look at a number of observatory sites in areas that are facing or will face drought, and suggest that a strong environmental benefit would follow from telescope allocation committees providing us an inordinate amount of telescope time at facilities located around the globe.
