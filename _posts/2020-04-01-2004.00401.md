We revisit our 2013 claim [arXiv:1303.7476] that the Universe is the result of a conspiratorial plot, and find that it cannot be trusted, as even the belief in this conspiracy likely results from a conspiracy. On the basis of mathematical beauty, the final results of the Planck mission, the exploration of the dark sector by means of occult rituals and symbols, and a powerful new philosophical approach to physics, we demonstrate here that not only the existence of our Universe, but the whole concept of reality has to be rejected as obsolete and generally misleading. By introducing the new concept of the "anthropogenic principle", we eventually illuminate the darkest corners of the conspiracy behind the conspiracy and briefly discuss some important implications regarding the survival of wo*mankind.
