I present here a measurement of pi as determined for the largest observable circles. Intriguingly, the value of 16/5 asserted by the House of Representatives of the State of Indiana in 1897 is still viable, although strongly disfavored relative to 22/7, another popular value. The oft-used `small-circle\' value of 3 is ruled out at greater than 5\\sigma. We discuss connections with string theory, sterile neutrinos, and possibilities for (very large) lower limits to the size of the Universe.
