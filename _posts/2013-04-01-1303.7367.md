The first search is reported for direct heffalon production, using 23.3/fb per experiment of delivered integrated luminosity of proton-proton collisions at rootS = 8TeV from the Large Hadron Collider. The data were recorded with the ATLAS and the CMS detectors. Each exotic composite is assumed to be stable on the detector lifetime (tau &gt;&gt; ns). A particularly striking signature is expected. No signal events are observed after event selection. The cross section for heffalon production is found to be less than 64ab at the 95% confidence level.
